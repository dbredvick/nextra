# I'm joining Vercel

## âœ¨ A note on the magic of the internet âœ¨

Patrick McKenzie [(@patio11)](https://twitter.com/patio11) coined a concept called "friendcatchers," or rather, his mom did.

The quote from a Microconf talk goes like this:

> Patrick, you should learn to cook. Don't learn to cook because you want to eat food - learn to cook because if you learn to cook you will have an excuse for the rest of your life to bring people over to your house.

A "Friendcatcher" is something you offer for free, that helps you catch friends. [^1]

["Why Next.js"](/posts/why-nextjs) has been read by about 1,000 people this year. And while that's not a ton of readers, each reader was interested in Next.js â€” my kind of people.

If there's a field, technology, or company you're interested in, I highly recommend writing about it.

Writing about [my experience with Next.js](/tags/next.js) is part of how I got this job.

## Next.js + Vercel

I'm thrilled to announce that I'm joining [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and start next week. I've been a believer in Next.js for quite a while now and am very excited to help more devs get into the Next.js & Vercel ecosystem.

Since using the framework on an internal tool back in 2018, I've used it on every project. Next.js has become more powerful over time yet still has a phenomenal developer experience.

Next.js deployed to Vercel gives me & every other frontend developer superpowers. The two together form a large [Pit of Success](https://philosopherdeveloper.com/posts/pit-of-success.html), making it simpler to do the right thing. Building a better internet happens one website at a time.

I've been super impressed with everything the Vercel team has done: fostering a great open source community, hosting multiple virtual conferences, open-sourcing tons of great starter projects, and all while creating a fantastic framework & platform. Everything they make is very thoughtful and polished.

I can't believe I'm joining such an amazing team and am super excited to start.
