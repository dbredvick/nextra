# I'm your new podcast co-host

I see a lot of people looking for podcast co-hosts right now in the SaaS world. I'm looking for one myself. Then I had a thought.

> Can you productize a podcast co-host?

Seems like a stupid question maybe, but let's give it a try.

Here's some audio you can use as you see fit to create your very own "two people talking about software" podcast.

By the way, here are some of my favorite podcasts you should check out for inspiration:
