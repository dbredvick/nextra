## So you're going headless

If you're accustomed to monolithic web frameworks like ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails, or Django there's a good chance authentication and authorization were baked into your previous tech stack.

This is one of the strengths of these types of frameworks: they give you a lot included out-of-the-box, auth included.

So if we're breaking up the monolith, what's next?

How do we solve for authentication in our Next.js app?

## NextAuth

Enter NextAuth.js â€” the fastest way to get up and running with authentication in a Next.js application. I've used NextAuth on several projects now and have been amazed at how great it works.

Tons of companies small and large are trusting NextAuth for their authentication needs in Next.js.

</div>

NextAuth is one of the few Next.js libraries that offers frontend and backend features in the same package. This is something I've been extremely bullish on.
