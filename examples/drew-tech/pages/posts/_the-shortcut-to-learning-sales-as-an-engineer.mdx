# The shortcut to learning sales as an engineer

So you're an engineer and you're here to learn sales?

I'm guessing that you're probably working on a problem that's **really** important to you.

How do I know that? You _finally_ decided learning sales is a good idea.

Let's get into it.

## What type of sales are we talking about?

I'm not going to talk about "shady used car sales". We're not in the business of selling bad cars to people that can't afford it and really high interest rates.

That's not selling, that's predatory behavior.

What we're talking about is helping customers find a product that fixes their problems, gives them value, and makes their lives easier. In exchange for that value, we're going to charge them a small fee. The small fee should be no more than 10% of the value we're creating.

That doesn't sound evil, right? Merely giving someone what they want?

## Why learn sales?

If you're an engineer that wants to someday be a founder ✋, learning sales is a great way to learn the other critical parts of the business.

Most of the time, the tech is not the risk. We're engineers. We know how to build things. Even really complicated things.

So what's the real risk? **That you can't find customers**, at least if we're working on SaaS. This post does not apply to startups focusing on fusion or the like.

Sales will help you see what's wrong with your product, what's right with it, and ultimately — **what people are willing to pay for**.

Sales is a process that can help you find [product-market-fit](https://future.a16z.com/about-product-market-fit/).

Sales teaches you how to identify customer pain points.

## What's the best way to learn sales as an engineer?

### The deep end

Start your startup, quit your job, and hope you can figure out how to close deals.

You'll learn how to sell or go broke trying.

Maybe not the best way to learn, but some people need a fire under them to learn.

### In a company

The easiest way to learn sales is by going to a company that has sales as part of its DNA, even better if you can join the go-to-market (GTM) team in some way.

The best role for engineers? _Sales engineer_.
