# What happened to getInitialProps?

Remember `getInitialProps`?

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: 0,
    paddingBottom: '56%',
    position: 'relative'
  }}
>
  <iframe

    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style={{ position: 'absolute' }}

</div>

Next.js has become more and more flexible over time.

Originally, `getInitialProps` was the only native data fetching method in Next.js.

Now, we've got:

    - `getStaticProps`
    - `getStaticPaths`
    - `getServerSideProps`

So why did Next.js add these new methods, and why is `getInitialProps` not used as frequently anymore? Let's look at some of the reasons.

## How does `getInitialProps` work?

### On the server

On the initial request, getInitialProps is called on the server. This data is used to populate the server-side rendered document. Developers would assume it's safe to make API calls using API keys, call secure endpoints, and read from environment variables here, though that's largely not the case.

### On the client

Why? Because as soon as the client takes over, getInitialProps will be called when you navigate to a new page. This code runs in the browser, meaning you wouldn't want to ship secrets to make those same API calls.

### Example

```jsx
Page.getInitialProps = async (ctx) => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')
  const json = await res.json()
  return { stars: json.stargazers_count }
}
```

No harm here, right? This can run on both the server and the client without issue.

But what if we call an API that requires an API key?

```jsx
const isServer = typeof window === 'undefined'

Page.getInitialProps = async (ctx) => {
  if (isServer) {
    const res = await fetch('https://example.com/secret-api-call', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.SECRET_API_KEY}`
      }
    })
    const json = await res.json()
    return { data: json.secret }
  } else {
    return { data: 'Not safe to call on the client' }
  }
}
```

Do we see any problems here? The answer is yes. Our `SECRET_API_KEY` will be leaked to the client in this case.

This also leads to performance issues. If we include [server-only modules](https://arunoda.me/blog/ssr-and-server-only-modules) not meant for the client, we can end up shipping massive JS bundles for no reason.

`getInitialProps` is a Swiss Army Knife of Next.js data fetching. Instead of being a generalist, let's reach for the right tool for the job.

## What to do instead?

If you're using `getInitialProps`, what's your path forward? If you needed server-side rendering, what are the options?

### Introducing getStaticProps & getStaticPaths

First things first, let's verify that you need server-side rendering. Lots of applications think SSR is required, but it's not. What's the alternative? Static rendering.

In Next.js, you can use `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` to render static parts of your app.

- `getStaticPaths` is used to generate a list of pages that your app should serve.
- `getStaticProps` is used to fetch data for that specific page.

While this isn't a great metaphor, think of `getStaticPaths` as creating a bunch of buckets for your app to fill. `getStaticProps` is called for each bucket, and you can use it to fill that bucket with specific data it needs.

Consider a company's blog as an example of a type of page that works great for static generation. You want to generate a list of all the blog posts and fetch the content for each blog post.

In this case, `getStaticPaths` would return a list of all the blog posts, and `getStaticProps` would return the content for each blog post.

**But what if the content in the CMS changes?**

Perfect, you discovered the use case [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/incremental-static-regeneration).

Instead of generating all the pages and fetching content at build time, you can fetch it at runtime.

<Image
  quality={85}
  alt={'Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) chart'}
  src={regenerationImage}
  layout="responsive"
  placeholder={'blur'}
/>

Use the getStaticPaths function, but specify a `revalidate` parameter to tell Next.js to re-generate the page when the data changes and the time expires.

This is a common pattern in web development called stale-while-revalidate.

We immediately serve the stale page to the user and update it with the new data as it's ready.

### Really need SSR? getServerSideProps is your friend

If you're confident that you need SSR and that ISR will not work for you, you can use `getServerSideProps` to fetch data for the server-side rendered page.

This will be called for each incoming request, and you can use it to fetch data for the server-side rendered page.

If using this approach, I'd recommend you set some caching headers on the response, so you're not burning through serverless compute time.

### Do I have to upgrade?

The quick answer: no. Next.js has phenomenal backward compatibility across versions. Are there still valid use cases for `getInitialProps`? **100% yes**. There are cases where grabbing Swiss Army Knife makes sense and cases where `getInitialProps` is a good fit.

Best of luck building your Next.js app!
