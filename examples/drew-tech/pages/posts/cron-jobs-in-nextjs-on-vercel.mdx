# Cron jobs in Next.js on Vercel

## I want to remind myself of my New Yearâ€™s resolution every day via text.

Why? None of those productivity apps have ever worked for me. I donâ€™t open them. I want to be reminded in an app I use every day, iMessage. Letâ€™s solve this with cron jobs, a Twilio API call, and Vercel hosting.

Lotâ€™s of apps use cron jobs. In the past, Iâ€™ve setup [cron jobs on linux](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux) servers to process orders, send notification emails, and run expensive SQL queries. Think of it as a list of tasks your server needs to run and the frequency to run them. Itâ€™s pretty simple to setup and is even shipped with Mac OS & Linux (check out `crontab`).

> But how do we run cron jobs in Vercel deploys? - You, right now, in your Google query

There are five quick steps you need to run cron jobs in a Vercel Next.js app.

## 1. Start your project

To create a quick Next.js project, I used `create-next-app` mentioned in the [Next.js docs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js#quick-start).

Youâ€™ll want to make sure you have:

- a `pages` folder
- an `api` folder inside the `pages` folder

## 2. Add your logic

Then, make sure you have a `/pages/api/text.js` (or do it in TypeScript for bonus points ðŸ˜Ž).

_Note: thereâ€™s no need to follow the rest of this step, unless youâ€™re building a resolution reminder app just like me._

Hereâ€™s what mine looks like:

If youâ€™re going to use TypeScript, follow the [Next.js guide](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#built-in-zero-config-typescript-support) to converting the initial project to TS.

Hereâ€™s the link to the example code: [text.ts](https://gist.github.com/dbredvick/602e398b61ac960e326fdd45dab67f3d). You will need to install the following packages as well: [package.json](https://gist.github.com/dbredvick/f2beb92070789b662849b8dc82092c21).

## 3. Add some security & deploy

Every project needs a little security. For this project, letâ€™s make sure our API route is requiring some auth. See the part where we are checking for `superSecretAPIKey`? You should come up with your own secret and save it for later. Weâ€™re going to be using that in step number five.

To deploy to Vercel, follow [this guide](https://vercel.com/docs#installing-now-cli) to deploy with the CLI.

## 4. Create a cron job

**Update: I no longer recommend using EasyCron for this step. Instead, I built [tryslater.com](https://tryslater.com).** It's got a great free tier it's built by yours truly.

This isnâ€™t truly going to be a cron job. Weâ€™re going to be using ~[EasyCron.com](https://easycron.com/?ref=156527)~ [tryslater.com](https://tryslater.com). They have a free tier thatâ€™s sufficient if youâ€™re fine with not adding security (you canâ€™t change headers in their free plan).

Hereâ€™s what we are trying to achieve:

## 5. Finish the security (optional)

Like I said, every app needs some security. In order to be secure with [EasyCron](https://easycron.com/?ref=156527), I recommend adding authorization headers to your HTTP call from within the UI.

Add an `Authorization` header to your call with the following:

This is adding some security, but is not the best option. If you need to _really_ secure your endpoint, I would recommend different approaches.

## And thatâ€™s it!

Congrats, you setup cron jobs inside of a serverless Next.js app hosted with Vercel. Please let me know if you ran into any problems.

Good luck on those resolutions!
