# PlanetScale on a plane ✈️

If you're using Prisma + PlanetScale, the airplane WiFi (or any slow WiFi, really) might cause some issues for you.

You might be seeing an error message like this:

> Invalid `prisma.user.findUnique()` invocation: Can't reach database server at `127.0.0.1`:`3306` Please make sure your database server is running at `127.0.0.1`:`3306`.

Edit your connection string like this, and you should be good to go:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/<your-db-name>?pool_timeout=0&connect_timeout=30
```

The default Prisma timeouts are around 10 seconds. Changing these two should get you up and running.

Have a safe flight 👋
