# Giving away my side project: GumroadWidgets.com

## The project

[GumroadWidgets.com](http://gumroadwidgets.com) is a site I built that's goal is to generate Scriptable code for Gumroad sellers to embed their product sales data on their iOS home screen.

**I'm giving it away.**

### The motivation

I'm always on the hunt for new side projects. Back in November of 2020 I saw a tweet from Pieter Levels about a Gumroad sales widget:

[](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1330576085151588352)

Here's the original image from [@levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1330573624827392003)

Pieter posted a [gist](https://gist.github.com/levelsio/a1ca0dd434b77ef26f6a7c403beff4d0) showing how his script works:

```
// Modified from @mutsuda's https://medium.com/@mutsuda/create-an-ios-widget-showing-google-spreadsheets-data-856767a9447e
// by @levelsio

// HOW TO
// 1) Make a Google Sheet, we'll pull the first cell e.g. A1
// 2) Publish your Google Sheet, File -> Publish To Web
// 3) Copy the SHEET_ID in the URL, put it in here below:
const endpoint =
  'https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/SHEET_ID/1/public/full?alt=json'
// 4) Install Scriptable @ https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188
// 5) Copy this entire script in to Scriptable (tip: you can send it to your iPhone via Whatsapp/Messenger/Telegram etc)

// Function that performs the request to the JSON endpoint
async function loadItems() {
  let at = endpoint
  let req = new Request(at)
  let corpo = await req.loadJSON()
  // We return just the cells
  return corpo.feed.entry
}
// Request the spreadsheet data
let json = await loadItems()

// Obtaining the content of the exact cell we are looking for
stockValue = json[0].content['$t']

// Create the widget
let w = new ListWidget()
// w.backgroundColor = new Color("#000080")

// Add the value of the stock to the widget
t = w.addText(stockValue)
t.textColor = Color.black()
t.font = new Font('Avenir-Heavy', 24)

Script.setWidget(w)
Script.complete()
```

I realized quickly that I could build a no-code friendly version of this and generate all of the Scriptable widget logic that directly uses the Gumroad API (instead of reading from a Google Sheet).

### Scriptable — what is it?

[Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/) is a tool to "automate iOS with JavaScript".

It's great for automating quite a few things on iOS if you know JS. Another great use case is creating these little display widgets for apps and services that do not yet have an iOS widget.

### A landing page

Around the same time I saw this tweet, I also saw [@derrickreimer's](https://twitter.com/derrickreimer) SavyCal landing page and it motivated me.

[Scheduling Software Your Recipients Will Love · SavvyCal](https://savvycal.com/)

_side note: check out their landing page if you haven't yet — it's amazing._

What I really wanted to make was an interactive example of what using my product would be like. Getting users clicking is a great way to increase conversions.

So I spent most of my time getting that interaction right. I'm actually super happy with what I came up with:

### What's next

The only thing left to do is create a generator that takes in:

- a user's color preferences
- a user's Gumroad API keys (to make the calls)
- a Gumroad product ID

and generates a custom version of Pieter's Scriptable widget code above.

Then you've got to list it on Gumroad and launch!

## Why I'm giving it away

I've currently got quite a few projects going on and don't have time to finish this.

While I am a fan of [Daniel Vassallo's](https://twitter.com/dvassallo) "have lots of small bets" idea, there is also such a thing as spreading yourself too thin.

Rather than letting this project die and be thrown into my side project graveyard, I thought maybe it would be best to give it a new owner.

**Maybe that person is you?**

## How to enter

Interested in taking this project over? I'll transfer the Github repo to you along with ownership of the domain.

I'm going to select the winner on Friday.

**To enter, do one of the following:**

- [email me](mailto:drewb@hey.com)
- [DM me](https://twitter.com/dbredvick) on Twitter
- reply to [this thread](https://twitter.com/DBredvick/status/1359155549963759619) on Twitter
- leave a top level comment on this [IndieHackers post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/free-giving-my-project-gumroadwidgets-an-ios-widget-generator-inspired-by-levelsio-c101a282af)

## What else am I working on?

So if I'm giving up on Gumroad Widgets, I must be working on other things, right? Correct.

I'm:

- Building V1 of FitVitals (I wrote about it [here](/posts/rome-wasn't-built-in-a-day-and-neither-was-my-saas-app))
- Shipping an MVP for for a site I use waaay too much (Twitter)
- Writing these posts

Stay tuned for an early access look at my Twitter project.
