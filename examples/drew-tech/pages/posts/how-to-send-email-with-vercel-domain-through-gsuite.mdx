# How to Send Email with Vercel Domain through GSuite

# Sending email with Vercel Domains

To send emails with a custom domain, we need to:

1. Buy the domain
2. Purchase email hosting
3. Configure DNS records on the domain

We will focus on steps two and three in this post. This post assumes you are using a domain purchased through Vercel and have `now` CLI access configured.

### You might be asking yourself:

> Why can't we use Vercel (or other domain provider) for emails? Do I _really_ need to pay more money?

The answer is yes. You do need to buy hosting. Namecheap has a [pretty good description](https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/what-is-email-hosting/) of why you need email hosting. Think of it as the same thing as website hosting, except for your emails.

### Enter GSuite

GSuite is an _alright_ product for sending emails from custom domains. This tool focuses on enterprise businesses, so the UX leaves something to be desired.

### Step One

Sign up for [GSuite](https://gsuite.google.com/) üí∞üí∏

### Step Two

Confirm you own the domain.

In GSuite admin, go to [Manage Domains](https://admin.google.com/AdminHome?hl=en#Domains:). Click _Add A Domain or Domain Alias_.

To verify you own the domain, you will need to set a TXT record on your domain's DNS settings.

With Vercel's CLI, it looks like the following:

List out your domains

```bash
vercel dns ls
```

Using Google's verification code, run the following command

```bash
vercel dns add YOURDOMAINHERE.com @ TXT YOURGOOGLEVERIFICATIONSTRINGHERE
```

Press _Validate_ in GSuite and then Google will try to confirm you own the domain. It may take some time before this works, be patient.

### Step Three

Setup MX records.

After you prove you own the domain, it's time to start forwarding emails to Google.

~~This is also done via DNS records on your domain. Run each of these in your CLI.~~

Update: Vercel added a feature to cover this step. Go to your domain, select "add email preset", and click "G Suite".

Then verify the MX records with GSuite.

### Step Four

Configure Gmail and GSuite.

Now, head over to Gmail.

Click on the settings gear, Accounts, and then ‚ÄúAdd another email address‚Äù.

Enter in your new email and select ‚ÄúTreat as an alias‚Äù.

You may see the error:

> Functionality not enabled. You must send emails through YOURDOMAINHERE.com SMTP servers when you send as you@YOURDOMAINHERE.com. However, this functionality is not available for your account. Please contact your domain administrator for more information.

To fix this error, hop over to the Gmail settings in GSuite for [End User Access](https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/gmail/enduseraccess?hl=en) and enable ‚ÄúAllow per-user outbound gateways‚Äù.

Wait a few minutes and add the email address again in Gmail to resolve this issue.

## Happy Emailing
