# TailwindUI and Next.js styling issues

Are you using TailwindUI and Next.js? If so, you might be here because you Google'd like this:

```html
This example requires updating your template:

<html class="h-full bg-white">
  <body class="h-full overflow-hidden"></body>
</html>
```

If you don't apply these, there's a high chance your layout copied over from TailwindUI won't scroll.

Getting your layout working requires adding those classes to the correct elements of your DOM.

<Image
  quality={85}
  alt={
    'Animation of scrolling working inside of a TailwindUI Next.js app with a multi-part layout.'
  }
  src={tailwindUIScroling}
  layout="responsive"
/>

While this is pretty easy to address, it can be tricky because of some of the underlying elements added to the DOM by Next.js.

## The solution

#### Create a CSS file with the following styles:

```css
#__next {
  @apply h-full overflow-hidden;
}
html {
  @apply h-full bg-white;
}
body {
  @apply h-full overflow-hidden;
}
```

#### Import the styles into your `_app.js` file:

```jsx
import './styles.css'
```

### And that's it

Now that you've got your layout working, you can go ahead and start building your site.
