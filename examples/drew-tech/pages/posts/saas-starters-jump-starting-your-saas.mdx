# SaaS Starters â€” how to jump start your software as a service

Work in Progress â€“ Still looking for Ruby on Rails starters to add. DM me if you have one!

## Introduction

In a quest to learn Django & Vue, I found a project, [SaaS Pegasus](https://www.saaspegasus.com/), that had great examples of how to build a software as a service using that stack.

A few commands later I had a working project locally with:

- Stripe integration
- A Postgres database
- A cron job runner connected to Redis
- Authentication and authorization
- Configured webpack
- A project hierarchy
- Naming conventions

and I'm probably missing much more the project provides.

### Should I use a SaaS starter?

Yes. Unequivocally yes.

Save yourself time, money, and effort & spend those resources finding product-market fit instead of setting up auth for the thousandth time.

Node coding the app yourself? Cool. Generate the codebase in a language your developer knows and hand it to them. You'll save one week of consulting fees and plenty of wasted time.

# List of SaaS Starters by language

## React SaaS starters

### Divjoy

In the past, I've used [Divjoy](https://divjoy.com?via=drew) to jump start my Next.js software projects. I built:

- QuickerQuestions (abandoned, wrote about it [here](/posts/what-not-to-work-on))
- QuarantineCup (a [free to play remote drinking game](https://quarantinecup.live/))

**What's included**

- UI kit integration (Bootstrap, Bulma, or MaterialUI)
- Can generate Next.js or Create-React-App projects
- Auth (Firebase or Auth0)
- Database (Firebase)
- Stripe integration
- Vercel or Netlify hosting configurations
- Newsletter integration (Mailchimp)
- Contact forms (Amazon SES, Google Sheets, Formspree, Airtable)
- Analytics (Simple Analytics, Google Analytics)

**Pros**

- High quality React code
- Author actively develops features & is easy to get in touch with
- Long list of included features
- Visual editor

**Cons**

- No TailwindUI integration
- No Supabase or AWS Amplify option for database
- No opinion on your backend architecture

**Price**: $149 one-time purchase

If you'd like more info, I've written an extensive [review of Divjoy](/posts/divjoy-is-it-worth-it) and keep it updated as new features launch.

### Gravity

~~Note: I have not used [Gravity](https://usegravity.app?ref=drew), this information is all publicly available info on their marketing website.~~

Update: I am using [Gravity](https://usegravity.app?ref=drew) on a current project. Review inbound. So far, so good.

**What's included**

- Payments with Stripe
- React UI
- REST API with Auth
- Email with Mailgun
- Admin / user management UI
- Onboarding flow
- Pre-built components
- Team support
- Authentication and Authorization
- Pick your database (MySQL, Mongo, Postgres, SQLite and more with Knex & Mongoose)

**Pros**

- Seems pretty fully featured
- Comes with Slack Community & 1 yr of support
- One of the few with "user onboarding"

**Cons**

- One of the higher prices

**Price:** $795

Their tagline is as follows:

> Save $16,403 by not writing these 10,000+ lines of code

A bold claim, but this starter includes _a lot_ of features and lines of code.

## Next SaaS starters

### Next.js Subscription Payments

I'm using [this starter](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-subscription-payments) right now for a project I have not yet launched. Under the hood it uses Supabase.

**In depth review coming soon**

**Price:** $0 â€“Â it's open source!

### Divjoy

We talked about [Divjoy](https://divjoy.com/?via=drew) a few sections up. It has the ability to generate Next.js projects as well as Create-React-App projects.

## Django SaaS starters

### SaaS Pegasus

I purchased [this starter](https://www.saaspegasus.com/) to learn what a mature Django & Vue architecture could look like.

**What's included**

- Stripe integration
- A Postgres database
- A cron job runner connected to Redis
- Authentication and authorization
- Great documentation

**Pros**

- This is some of the best documentation I've seen with a starter project
- The interactive examples make creating your own functionality a breeze. Copy and paste. Done.

**Cons**

- Honestly, hard to think of any if this is your tech stack of choice

**Price: $295 for a single site, $750 for unlimited**

## Laravel SaaS starters

### [Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/) + [Spark](https://spark.laravel.com/)

If you are a Laravel dev, I'm sure you've already heard of these options. They're amazing and should be your default choice.

**Price:** $99 per project or $199 for unlimited (Spark only, Jetstream is free)

## Ruby SaaS starters

Used a good Ruby on Rails starter before? DM me and I'll add it to the list!

## .NET SaaS starters

### AspNetZero

I couldn't find many .NET options, but [this one](https://aspnetzero.com/) seemed to be the most legit. Disclaimer: I didn't spend two grand on a .NET SaaS starter, so this info is all from their marketing pages.

**What's included**

- .NET Core and Angular SPA
- .NET Core and jQuery web app
- [ASP.NET](http://asp.NET) MVC Angular SPA
- [ASP.NET](http://asp.NET) MVC jQuery web app
- XAMARIN mobile app that integrates with the above apps

**Pros**

- includes 15 incident support
- 30 day money back guarantee
- Really includes the whole gamut (front end, back end, native)
- If you're reading this section, you probably want a .NET solution (which this is)

**Cons**

- Price tag
- .NET (all joking aside, I love .NET Core and think C# is an awesome language)
- This offers so many features, I'm assuming it's a massive codebase. Probably too much code for simply starting a side project.

**Price: $1,999** ðŸ¤¯

This is the by far the most expensive option, but I think this company's target market is companies and not developers trying to build a side project. (Check out the brands listed on their marketing page â€” Deloitte has a pretty big budget)

### Have a starter to add?

DM me your starter on Twitter and I'll add it do the list.
