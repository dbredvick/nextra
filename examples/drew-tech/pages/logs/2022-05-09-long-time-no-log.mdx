# 75/1000 — Long time no log

I've made a ton of progress on this project over the last couple of months.

I've:

- built a [Vercel integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/slater)
- renamed the app to Slater and got [tryslater.com](https://tryslater.com)
- finished cron job functionality
- moved to [code-first](https://tryslater.com/docs)
- created a [docs site](https://tryslater.com/docs)
- create a [changelog](https://changelog.tryslater.com)

Up next:

- finish up the Vercel integration so I can get it approved
- improve the onboarding experience
- improve lifecycle emails
- improve callback state for unauthed callback

It's a long road, but we're a lot closer than we were a few months ago.

See you on the other side.
