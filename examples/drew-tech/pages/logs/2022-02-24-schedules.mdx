# 45 and 46/1000 — Cron execution

This update covers two days of work, partially because I don't feel the need to Tweet an update with the state of the world at this moment.

## 45/1000 DynamoDB + Serverless

I was able to process a cron job from end to end finally.

Half of the battle was sharing a table between various serverless functions. It turns out that the easiest way is to use CloudFormation variables.

```yaml
Outputs:
  scheduleTableArn:
    Value:
      Fn::GetAtt:
        - ScheduleTable
        - Arn
    Export:
      Name: scheduleTableArn
  cronTableArn:
    Value:
      Fn::GetAtt:
        - CronTable
        - Arn
    Export:
      Name: cronTableArn
```

Then after exporting, consuming them in the other `serverless.yml` files

```yaml
Resource:
  - ${cf:cron-scheduler-${self:provider.stage}.scheduleTableArn}
```

## 46/1000 Cron E2E

After that, I figured out cron job execution from end-to-end.

At the moment, I've included a limited scope for the MVP:

- GET calls only
- Three retries by default
- Only storing status code of request
- No support for custom headers
- No support for custom payload
- No failure alerts

Victory.
