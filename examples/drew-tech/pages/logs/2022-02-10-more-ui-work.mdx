# 43/1000 — more (Tailwind)UI work

All of the marketing pages are mostly taken care of, now we're getting into the weeds of the application.

Here's a quick look at what's left:

### UI tasks

- Get the "/app" route rendering a basic layout. Thinking of using [this TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/page-examples/home-screens#component-af4086fe483fb8a418175cf0218dd5c4) home screen example.
- CRUD UI for cron jobs
- Build onboarding flow

### Backend tasks

- Create API for cron jobs
- Implement metered billing (with 5 cron jobs on free tier)
-

### Other

- Add Slack alerting
- Add analytic events
- Add LogRocket
- Add Axiom Vercel integration

## Today's goal

Finish the first task on the UI list: Get the "/app" route rendering a basic layout.
